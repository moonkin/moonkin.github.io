## Welcome!
My name is Anastasia Tsikoza, I live in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and I am a newly accepted Outreachy intern at Debian. I am participating in the December 2018 to March 2019 internship round. This winter I'll be working on the project "Improve integration of Debian derivatives with Debian infrastructure and community".

Outreachy interns are required to write several blog posts about their experience and here I am going to share mine.

## What is Outreachy?
Outreachy is an internship program supporting diversity in tech. It provides paid, remote and full-time internships in Free and Open Source Software. Rounds take place twice a year and last for three months. Before each round there is a six-week application period when you need to make small contributions to the projects you want to join. Most projects require programming skills (at least basic), but some can be related to documentation and design.

## My tasks
All project tasks are listed on [wiki.debian.org](https://wiki.debian.org/Outreachy/Round16/Projects/DerivativesIntegration). Once I start working on any of them, I'll try to describe it here in more details. My contributions to the project's source code will appear on [salsa.debian.org](https://salsa.debian.org/deriv-team/census/commits/master).

## Miscellaneous
This picture of an Icelandic black-sand beach in the background is taken by [Norbert von Niman](https://www.norrisniman.com/about). Iceland is wonderful. It inspires me and I wish to visit it one day.
