## Welcome!
My name is Anastasia Tsikoza, I live in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and I am a newly accepted [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) intern at Debian. This winter I'll be working on the project "Improve integration of Debian derivatives with Debian infrastructure and community". In this blog I am going to write about my experience within the internship.

## Project tasks
All project tasks are listed on [wiki.debian.org](https://wiki.debian.org/Outreachy/Round16/Projects/DerivativesIntegration). Once I start working on any of them, I'll try to describe it here in more details.

## Contact information
You can send me an [email](mailto:anastasia.tsikoza@gmail.com) or find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/moonkin29).

## Miscellaneous
This picture of an Icelandic black-sand beach in the background is taken by [Norbert von Niman](https://www.norrisniman.com/about). Iceland is wonderful. It inspires me and I wish to visit it one day.
